# SystemAnalist-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was DriverPass, They wanted what amounts to an online storefront for their business, This involved yyour standard storefront fare, with the added option of a 
package system that would determine the type of class a student would get. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel I did well with the diagraming part of this project, it felt intuitive.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to flesh out my use case diagram a bit more, put more function cases into it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
This project had a transcript of an interview that I interpreted into these diagrams, basically I just read carefully and made a list of needs, then I transferred these into my diagrams.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I used to take a "play by ear" approach to programming, with a general idea and a rough list of requirements, now that I have learned about these diagraming techniques and design techniques  I will implement them into future planning for programming.
